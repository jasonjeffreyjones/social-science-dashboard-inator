# Social Science Dashboard Inator

## Overview
Social Science Dashboard Inator is a web application to fully automate data collection and analysis of daily, short online surveys.

## Features
- **Persistent:** Continuous measurement instead of one-off studies.
- **Consistent:** A simple operationalization with repeated measurement.
- **Transparent:** Shared microdata, downloadable analysis scripts.
- **Standardized:** One file, standard column structure.
- **Automated:** Easy setup.  New data arrives in your email inbox every day.  Analysis scripts re-run while you sleep.

## Usage
There are two tracks: **Do-it-yourself (DIY) Inator** and **Fully Automated Luxury Data as a Public Good (FALDaPGoo) Intator**.
1. **DIY:** You're looking at it.  Fork this repository and make it work for you.  Follow my development of the *JJJP AI Daily Dashboard*.  It is a bespoke version of an Inator. 
2. **FALDaPGoo:** I am slowly developing the general purpose, fully automated version.  Speedy development awaits a funder with vision.
