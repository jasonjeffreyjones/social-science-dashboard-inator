# Social Science Dashboard Inator

## Overview
Social Science Dashboard Inator is a web application to fully automate data collection and analysis of daily, short online surveys.

## Features
- **Persistent:** Continuous measurement instead of one-off studies.
- **Consistent:** A simple operationalization with repeated measurement.
- **Transparent:** Shared microdata, downloadable analysis scripts.
- **Standardized:** One file, standard column structure.
- **Automated:** Easy setup.  New data arrives in your email inbox every day.  Analysis scripts re-run while you sleep.

## Roadmap
- A demonstration implementation is available at [https://jasonjones.ninja/social-science-dashboard-inator/jjjp-ai-daily-dashboard/](https://jasonjones.ninja/social-science-dashboard-inator/jjjp-ai-daily-dashboard/).
- A preprint describing the project: [Americans' Support for AI Development - Measured Daily with Open Data and Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05163)
- Before uploading code, I need to remove hard-coded values specific to my implementation.  I will do this soon.

## Usage
There will be two tracks: **Do-it-yourself (DIY) Inator** and **Fully Automated Luxury Data as a Public Good (FALDaPGoo) Inator**.
1. **DIY:** Fork this repository and make it work for you. 
2. **FALDaPGoo:** I am slowly developing the general purpose, fully automated version.  Speedy development awaits a funder with vision.
